    """Quantize the specified model submodules

    Recursively quantize the submodules of the specified parent model.

    Only modules that have quantized counterparts will be quantized.

    If include patterns are specified, the submodule name must match one of them.

    If exclude patterns are specified, the submodule must not match one of them.

    Include or exclude patterns are Unix shell-style wildcards which are NOT regular expressions. See
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html for more details.

    Note: quantization happens in-place and modifies the original model and its descendants.

    Args:
        model (`torch.nn.Module`): the model whose submodules will be quantized.
        weights (`Optional[Union[str, qtype]]`): the qtype for weights quantization.
        activations (`Optional[Union[str, qtype]]`): the qtype for activations quantization.
        include (`Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]`):
            Patterns constituting the allowlist. If provided, module names must match at
            least one pattern from the allowlist.
        exclude (`Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]`):
            Patterns constituting the denylist. If provided, module names must not match
            any patterns from the denylist.
