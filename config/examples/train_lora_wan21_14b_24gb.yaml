# IMPORTANT: The Wan2.1 14B model is huge. This config should work on 24GB GPUs. It cannot
# support keeping the text encoder on GPU while training with 24GB, so it is only good
# for training on a single prompt, for example a person with a trigger word.
# to train on captions, you need more vran for now.
