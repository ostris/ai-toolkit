  Launch an AI Toolkit LoRA training run on a hosted RunPod GPU from the Mac
  CLI (replaces the Colab+Drive workflow). Use when: (1) the user has a
  training config + captioned dataset ready and says "train this on RunPod",
  "launch a remote run", "kick off training in the cloud", "run this on a
  hosted GPU", "spin up a pod and train", (2) the user wants to start a run
  whose samples/checkpoints stream back to the Mac for review, (3) any time a
  local config is ready and the user does NOT want to train on their own
  machine. Drives scripts/remote/cli.py preflight -> up (provision + sync +
  launch) in the ai-toolkit repo. Hands off to ai-toolkit-remote-monitor for
  the watch/review loop and ai-toolkit-remote-teardown for shutdown. This is
  the KICKOFF skill only — for an already-running pod use the monitor skill.

# AI Toolkit remote launch (RunPod)

Kick off a LoRA training run on a RunPod Secure Cloud pod. Everything runs
from the Mac CLI via `scripts/remote/cli.py` in the **ai-toolkit repo**
(`~/repos/ai-toolkit`); the pod runs the pinned `ostris/aitoolkit` image.

This skill covers **launch only**: validate the config, provision a pod,
sync the dataset + config up, and start training under the cost-safe
sentinel wrapper. Once it's running, switch to
**`ai-toolkit-remote-monitor`** to follow it and **`ai-toolkit-remote-teardown`**
to shut down.

## Preconditions (check, don't assume)

The remote pipeline is config-and-dataset-in, trained-LoRA-out. Before
launching, the upstream prep should already be done (these have their own
skills): config generated (`ai-toolkit-lora-config` /
`flux2-klein-lora-config`), dataset captioned (`ai-toolkit-gemini-captioner`),
captions audited (`style-vs-content-caption-auditor`). If the dataset looks
unprepped, route there first — a remote run costs real money, so don't
launch a config you haven't validated locally.

`.env` in the repo must carry `RUNPOD_API_KEY`, `RUNPOD_STOP_API_KEY`, and
`HF_TOKEN`. If `RUNPOD_API_KEY` is missing the CLI says so; the README
§1 documents setup.

## The launch sequence

```bash
cd ~/repos/ai-toolkit

# 1. Preflight — free, no network. Validates YAML + dataset, rewrites all
#    local paths to pod paths, writes runs/<run>/remote_config.yaml.
python scripts/remote/cli.py preflight config/examples/<config>.yaml

# 2. up — provision + sync + launch in one shot.
python scripts/remote/cli.py up config/examples/<config>.yaml \
    --gpu MAXQ --gpu-fallback "A100" --gpu-fallback "A100 SXM"
```

Always run `preflight` first and read its output — it reports every path
remap, the dataset file/caption counts, and any warnings (e.g.
`save.push_to_hub` forwarding a write-scoped HF token). A preflight failure
is free; a bad config discovered after provisioning is not.

`up` chains preflight -> provision -> sync -> launch and **tears the pod
down if any post-provision step fails**, so a half-provisioned pod never
idle-bills. If you want the steps separately (e.g. to inspect the pod
before launching), run `provision`, `sync`, then `launch` individually —
same flags.

### GPU choice

Default to **MaxQ** (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, 96GB, ~$0.50/hr Secure) — it's
the cheapest 80GB+ card and handles Klein/Flux.2 unquantized. Always pass
`--gpu-fallback` because any single GPU type is frequently out of stock.
A sensible chain: `--gpu MAXQ --gpu-fallback "A100" --gpu-fallback "A100 SXM"`.
Aliases live in `scripts/remote/pod.py` (`MAXQ`, `A100`, `A100 SXM`, `H100`,
`PRO 6000`, `4090`, `5090`, `L40S`, ...); unknown names pass through as exact
RunPod ids.

| GPU (alias) | VRAM | Secure $/hr |
|---|---|---|
| `MAXQ` | 96G | ~0.50 |
| `A100` (PCIe) | 80G | ~1.39 |
| `A100 SXM` | 80G | ~1.49 |
| `H100` (SXM) | 80G | ~3.29 |

A 3000-step Klein run on MaxQ is roughly **$2.50**.

## What "up" actually does (so you can narrate it / debug it)

1. **preflight** (again, idempotent) — derived config + hash into the manifest.
2. **provision** — creates the pod, filters for direct public-IP SSH (proxy
   SSH can't carry rsync), sizes the volume from steps/save_every, injects
   `PUBLIC_KEY` / `HF_TOKEN` / `RUNPOD_STOP_KEY` / `HF_HOME`, overrides the
   container start command so the pod survives the image's UI process
   exiting, and **probes the stop key before spending** — if it warns the
   key can't stop pods, fix it (teardown skill / README §1) before relying
   on unattended self-stop.
3. **sync** — rsyncs dataset + ctrl images + derived config + self-stop tool
   + the local repo overlay (allowlisted dirs) up.
4. **launch** — uploads the sentinel wrapper + max-runtime timer, starts
   `run.py` inside tmux, then block-tails the log and reports one of:
   `warming` (model download, 20-60 min on first run — expected),
   `running` (already training), or `crashed` (prints the traceback, leaves
   the pod up for diagnosis).

When `up` returns with the run RUNNING or warming, **hand off**: tell the
user the run name and that you'll follow it, then use
`ai-toolkit-remote-monitor`.

## Re-launch / resume guards

If the manifest already records a live pod, `provision`/`up` **refuse**
(so you can't double-bill) — use `status`/`down`/`rescue` on the existing
pod, or `--force-new` to deliberately provision a second one.

`launch` refuses if checkpoints already exist remotely unless you pass
`--resume` (continue from the latest checkpoint — ai-toolkit auto-resumes)
or `--fresh` (move the old output aside and start clean; this also resets
the local pull watermarks).

## Cost safety (what protects you)

The pod stops *itself* when training ends: the wrapper writes an exit-code
sentinel, waits for the laptop's `pulled.ok` ack (bounded by `--max-grace`,
default 30 min), then self-stops via the RunPod API. A separate
max-runtime timer (`--max-hours`, default 24) is the hard backstop. **Laptop
sleep cannot leave a pod billing.** This was live-validated 2026-06-10.

Set tighter bounds for short runs: `--max-hours 2 --max-grace 240`.

## Common mistakes

- **Launching without preflight** — you discover a bad path after paying for
  a pod. Preflight is free; always run it.
- **No `--gpu-fallback`** — single GPU types go out of stock constantly;
  the run fails fast instead of falling back.
- **Forgetting this is the launch skill** — if the pod is already running,
  don't re-`up` (it refuses anyway); use `ai-toolkit-remote-monitor`.
- **Assuming `warming` is a hang** — first runs download ~18GB of Klein/
  Flux.2 weights before step 1. 20-60 min of silence is normal.
- **Passphrase-protected SSH key** — the pipeline uses a dedicated
  passphrase-less `~/.ssh/aitk_remote_ed25519` (BatchMode can't prompt);
  if SSH "times out" during provision, that key is missing (README §1).

## Related skills

- `ai-toolkit-remote-monitor` — follow the run, pull artifacts, drive the
  sample-review loop, decide when to stop.
- `ai-toolkit-remote-teardown` — `down`/`rescue`, cost report, orphan-pod
  scan.
- `ai-toolkit-lora-config` / `flux2-klein-lora-config` — generate the config.
- `style-vs-content-caption-auditor` — audit captions before the run.
